# Vehicle-Rent-Management-System
This project is written in x86 assembly language using the Irvine library. It is about the rent management system of vehicles. It is a menu-based project that allows a user to enter vehicle specifications such as the name, model, time, and return of vehicles like automobiles or bikes. The next step involves reading information from a file to look for the model entered by the user which is done by the file handling. The program then prompts the user to enter client information and write in a file. Once the user enters this information, then the fare is calculated according to the time entered by the user. Then finally that specific vehicle is handed over to the client.
